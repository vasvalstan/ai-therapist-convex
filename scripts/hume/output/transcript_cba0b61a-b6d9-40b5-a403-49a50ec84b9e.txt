But my question is, how do you engage? How does you know, anthropic, the AI community, developers of these super capable models how do they engage with, let's just say, the net the US national security community, the intelligence community, and, practically, you know, what does that mean for the development of AI? And if you tell me you'd have to kill me I don't need to know that.
